===============================
## Frogger clone
This is project 3 for the Udacity Nanodegree program.  
### Description
This project contains HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files.  It also contains the assets required for the game such  as IMG files.
### How to run 
Simply open index.html with a web browser.
### How to play
Just like the classic version, the goal of this game is to get the hero across the  road without colliding with any bugs.  Once you get to the river you start again at a faster speed.  After a collision the game resets.  Your score is  displayed at the top.
### Usage
Use the following arrow keys:
* Up: Moves player Up
* Down: Moves player Down
* Right: Moves player Right
* Left: Moves player Left

### Questions for pondering:

* Where should collision event handling occur? Player, enemy, outside???
* Is there a need for player.update function in this case since all player events are triggered by key events.
* Is the process for erasing and writing scores the best solution for such display?
* How to prevent ghost images from old scores from sticking to the screen.
